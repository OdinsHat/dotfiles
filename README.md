# dotfiles
**NOT** all of my dotfiles. A more complete loist is kjept in a 
private repo at [Gitlab](https://www.gitlab.com) but it seems 
the [de rigueur](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/de_rigueur)
to have your [dotfiles on Github](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=dotfiles&type=) 
these days.
