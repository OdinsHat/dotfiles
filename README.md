# dotfiles
**NOT** all of my dotfiles. A more complete loist is kept in a 
private repo at [Gitlab](https://www.gitlab.com) but it seems 
the [de rigueur](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/de_rigueur)
to have your [dotfiles on Github](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=dotfiles&type=) 
these days.

# Organisation
All the files are kept in a single directory and without the starting '.'. Files that are meant to be kept in a directory are named with the directory being separated by a hyphen. E.g. ~/config/terminator/.config == config-terminator-config
